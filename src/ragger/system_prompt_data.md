## Regionalization Principle

### Geographical "Pods" System
To manage the vast distances of the tournament, the group stage schedule is organized into geographical "pods" or clusters. Each group is assigned a small number of nearby host cities. Teams within the same group will only play their matches at these designated venues to minimize travel and create a regional "base" for fans. Except for rare logistical exceptions, a group will not jump between different coasts or countries.
